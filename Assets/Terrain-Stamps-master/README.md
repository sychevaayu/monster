# Terrain Stamps

This is a collection of various textures and brushes for the Unity Terrain Stamp Tool.

When I started with Unity I got terrain height maps from other developers who shared them for free, so I thought I'd give back to this awesome community :-)

A typical use case is to stamp on a terrain and then apply terrain textures (grass, rock, etc) via a rule-set supporting asset (e. g. Vegetation Studio Pro with Meadow Environment).

## About the Textures

The textures for the stamps were generated procedurally using World Creator 2. 

World Creator 2 is a very powerful real-time terrain generator. Creating those terrains took only a few minues. You can check out World Creator 2 here, if you are interested:

A few example screenshots to see how the stamps in this repository look like:

Maybe download the repository and check out all of them with an image viewer to get a better overview.

## Additional Information

Please note that as to the writing of this page the Stamp Tool of Unity doesn't support resize and rotation via Mouse. I created a version of the Stamp Tool which supports those features. You can get it from here:

Let's hope Unity will support this in a future release out of the box.

## Requirements

* Unity 2018.3+

## Credits & Greetings

Credits and greetings to the developers of World Creator 2 and the awesome community on the World Creator discord. Without their hard work this wouldn't have been possible so easily. And the help and support you get from the community is most remarkable.
